# SFML Game Development Book
This is the which is explained in the book `SFML Game Development`. That book is awesome and i've learn a TON with it. Mostly about how i can work with the graphic library, create useful data structures to aid me in the game and C++ techniques.

## Makefile
- In order to build the game using the `Makefile` you will need to run the following command: `make bin/Galirr_Legacy`
*This command will create a `build` folder containing the objects of the .cpp files and a `bin` folder containing the executables.*


- In order to clean the folder (deletes the build folder), simply use: `make clean`
