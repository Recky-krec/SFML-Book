Events and real-time input â€“ when to
use which

if (sf::Mouse::isButtonPressed(sf::Mouse::Left))
// WHILE the left mouse button is being pressed, do something
if (event.type == sf::Event::MouseButtonPressed)
// WHEN the left mouse button has been pressed, do something

In the first if statement we do something during the time that the mouse is being
pressed down, while in the second version we only do something once after we have
pressed the button down.
